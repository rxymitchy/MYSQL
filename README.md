# Breaking Barriers: Youth Employment & Fair Wages - PLP DB Project  

Presentation: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGeEzBOokA/s1mdVPLGleXGOxtfOCEKXA/edit?utm_content=DAGeEzBOokA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth**, addressing the challenges young job seekers face in securing fair employment opportunities. Many entry-level jobs demand excessive experience, offer low wages, and exhibit gender biases, creating barriers for youth—especially young women—in the job market.  

Using **database design, SQL queries, and Excel analysis**, this project identifies trends, disparities, and provides data-driven recommendations to improve youth employment conditions, with a focus on Kenyan cities (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu).  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ **Identify trends & disparities** in youth employment and wages.  
✔ **Analyze job requirements vs. reality** (e.g., "entry-level" roles demanding 3+ years of experience).  
✔ **Evaluate salary fairness** across genders and locations.  
✔ **Provide policy & hiring recommendations** based on data insights.  

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored  
- How many "entry-level" jobs require unrealistic experience?  
- What is the average salary offered to young applicants?  
- Are there gender disparities in hiring outcomes?  
- How do wages compare across different Kenyan cities?  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Database:** Relational SQL database (tables: `companies`, `job_listings`, `applicants`, `applications`)  
- **SQL:** Querying for trends in experience requirements, salaries, and gender bias.  
- **Excel:** Pivot tables, charts, and an **interactive dashboard** for visualization.  

---

## 📊 Key Findings  
### 📌 **Insight 1:** Excessive Experience Requirements  
- Many "entry-level" jobs demand **3+ years of experience**, locking out fresh graduates.  

### 📌 **Insight 2:** Low Salaries Below Living Wage  
- Average entry-level salaries are **far below sustainable living costs**, especially in major cities.  

### 📌 **Insight 3:** Gender Disparities in Hiring  
- **Young women face additional hurdles** in securing jobs, leading to unequal employment rates.

## 📋 Recommendations  
✅ **Revise job descriptions** to reflect true entry-level expectations.  
✅ **Adjust salary structures** to meet living wage standards.  
✅ **Promote gender-inclusive hiring** through targeted policies.
