1. **State and Explain the components of a DBMS (Database Management System):**  
   - **Data:** Stores information in a structured format.  
   - **Software:** Manages the database operations.  
   - **Hardware:** Physical devices like servers or computers.  
   - **Users:** People interacting with the system (administrators, developers, end-users).  
   - **Procedures:** Rules and guidelines for database use.  

2. **What is a relational database? Give 4 examples:**  
   A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns.  
   **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.  

3. **State and Explain three classifications of SQL:**  
   - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines database structures (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`).  
   - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Manages data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`).  
   - **DCL (Data Control Language):** Controls permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).  

4. **What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?**  
   - **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for a table record (no duplicates).  
   - **Foreign Key:** Links records between tables by referencing a primary key in another table.  

5. **What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?**  
   Itâ€™s a visual representation of database entities and their relationships, showing how data is connected.  

6. **What are the advantages of relational databases?**  
   - Data integrity  
   - Avoids data redundancy  
   - Easy data access using SQL  
   - Data security and multi-user support  

7. **State four types of data types used to store data in tables:**  
   - **INT:** For whole numbers  
   - **VARCHAR:** For text or strings  
   - **DATE:** For date values  
   - **BOOLEAN:** For true/false data  

8. **What is the purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)?**  
   To efficiently store, retrieve, manage, and secure data, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and accessibility.
