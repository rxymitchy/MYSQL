- **customerName**, **email**, and **customerAddress** from the **customer** table.
- **TotalAmount** and **Status** from the **bills** table.

4. 👤 One-to-One Relationship: Users and User Profiles

You are given two tables, **users** and **user_profiles**, where:

 - The users table contains **user_id** and **username**.
 - The user_profiles table contains **profile_id**, **user_id**, and **profile_data**.

Write an SQL query to create the two tables, ensuring the following:

 - The **users** table has **user_id** as the _primary key_ and a **username**.
 - The **user_profiles** table has _profile_id_ as the _primary key_, and it references the **user_id** from the users table with a **foreign key** constraint.
 - Ensure that the **user_id** in the **user_profiles** table is unique, creating a one-to-one relationship between the two tables.

5. 👥 One-to-Many Relationship: Departments and Employees

You are given two tables, **departments** and **employees**, where:

 - The **departments** table contains **department_id** and **department_name**.
 - The **employees** table contains **employee_id**, **employee_name**, and **department_id**.

Write an SQL query to create the two tables, ensuring the following:

 - The **departments** table has **department_id** as the **primary key** and a **department_name**.
 - The **employees **table has **employee_id** as the primary key, and the **department_id** is a _foreign key_ referencing the **department_id** in the departments table.
 - The relationship between departments and employees is a one-to-many relationship (one department can have multiple employees).
